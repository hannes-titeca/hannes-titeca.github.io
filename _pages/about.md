I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Exeter.

I have been undertaking research on how prosocial/cooperative behaviours are affected by psychological factors. I am grateful to the ESRC for funding my PhD and MSc studies with a "1+3" scholarship. I also undertake part-time undergraduate teaching and marking as a postgraduate teaching assistant for the Economics Department at Exeter.

My supervisors are Prof. Brit Grosskopf, Dr Sebastian Kripfganz & Prof. Rajiv Sarin.
