I am a PhD qualified researcher with a background in behavioural and experimental economics. I have extensive experience of research and analysis through leading on all aspects of multiple research projects. This includes study/research design, execution/data collection (including experiment/survey design, programming and roll-out), data analysis, reporting/data visualisation, and communicating insights to internal and external stakeholders. 

Prior to my academic (Lecturer in Economics) and industry roles,  my PhD research (conducted as an ESRC funded student) at the University of Exeter focused on how prosocial/cooperative behaviours are affected by psychological factors.
